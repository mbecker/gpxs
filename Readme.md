# Motivation
I'm using Strava quite heavily (3-5 runs / week). For my sport activities like running, cyclinh, hiking, etc. I'm using the Strava iOS App. Unfortunatley I started with Runkeeper years ago and switched for a time to Garmind and other tools. Once I exported (more or less all) my tracks from all third parties and uploaded the gpx files to Strava. Strava analyzed all the files for me and added the activities to my logs. Nice!

I want to have all my activites on my local desktop to analyze the gpx files and create nice graphics. For that I downloaed all my gpx files from Strava and started to look how to parse the gpx files. That's how I discovered gpxgp.

The fantastic library gpxgo (https://github.com/tkrajina/gpxgo/issues) by tkrajina parses gpx files and returns information of the gpx/tracks/segements/points like distance, duration and movingtime/distance + stoppedtime/distance.

Unfortunatley the gpx information like distance (movingdistance), duration (movingtime) does not match with the Strava information.  My assumption is that Strava does a quite good and should be the baseline to match. I looked into the libraray and noticed for example that the distance calculation is quite fast but less accurate then other GPS distance clulcation formulas like Haversine and Vincenty. I started to implement these formulas in the libraray and quickly noticed hat for each part of the gpx (gpx->track->segment->point) the data is re-calculated new. Additionaly the points which are used for the caluclation for "Moving"Time/Distance are based on the assumption that the speed between two points must be greater than 1.0m/s. That results in a big difference of "Moving"Time/Distance of Strava and the library.

**So I've started to update te libraray as follows:**
- change the methoed how the data is aggregated
- User provides the the caluclation of distance, duration, speed, pace, etc.
- Added new GPS distance cluclation
- Use standard deviation to determine which points should be used for "Moving"Time/Distance

**How is the data now agregated?**
At first the point data like duration, distane between the previous poind and the actual point is caluclated (with the user provided methods). The the data is then aggregated to the next level (point; all points->segment; all segments->track; all tracks->gpx).

User methoed to calculate distance, duration, speed, pace?
The idea is that the uses who uses this libraray provides own methods to calculate the points data. That means the users could use a GPS distance calculatio not yet provided by the library.

**New GPS distance cluclation**
Added a method to use GPS formula Vincenty.

**Standard deviation for "Moving"Time/Distance?**
A points has the following data: lat/long (where), timestamp (when). With information where and when between the previous and actual point you could calculate the distance (how long in meters?) and duration (how long in seconds?).
It's quite normal that you stop during an activity (waiting on the street, doing a longer pause, etc) and then the distance/duratin between the point before and after the could be quite long. Let's say your are doing a cycling tour to a castale; at the castle you stop (Point p1(position0, time0)) and after 1hour you are cycling back (start of the return Point p2(position0+100m, tie0+3600seconds)). The speed would be 
```
P2(position0+100m)-P2(position0) / P1(time0+36000) - P1(time0) -> 100m / 3600sec -> ~0,0278 m/s = 0,10008 km/h
```
Obvious the data between these two point p0 and p1 shouldn't be used for the "Moving"Time/Distance since p1 is a new startig point. The next point p2 should be used for "Moving"Time/Distance (p2-p1)
The idea of gpxgo is that the speed between two points must be grater than 1m/s and then the points is used for the caluclation. The approach is fair enough since it's quite fast. But for me the different to Strava is too much (for example a cycling tours is with gpxgo 3h20min and with Stava it's 2h45min which is the "real" movingtime from my trip).

The standard deviation 8https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) useses all point data of the gpx track and "is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values". In my word: You define a weightehd average of all points duration and then define that only the points should be used which are close enough to that duration average (like 90% or 95%).
With an standard deviation Sigma Ïƒ of 1.644854 (~95%) I'm quite close the Strava information. So good enough for me!

**Performance**
See benchmarks below.
My assumption was that the "new" libraray gpxs is faster than gpxgox because of the new aggregation method. For a benchmark of Vincenty I added the method to gpxgo. gpxgo does not use the standard deviation; so the following benchmarks shows
__Basic distance cluclation; no standard deviation; default speed threshold of 1m/sec (gpx files: 1046)__
gpxs (3) 17.2373831s vs. gpxgo (1) 19.1264728s

__Vincenty distance calculation; no standard deviation; default speed threshold of 1m/sec (gpx files: 1046)__
gpxs (2) 23.014476s vs. gpxgo (2) 25.3617024s

__Vincenty distance caluclation; standard deviation of 1.644854__
gpxs (1) 21.5685324s vs. pxgo (not implemented)

**Conclusion**
The reuslts of gpxs (distance, "moving"time/distance, "stopped"time/distance) are for me more accurate. "More accurate" means for the calculated infomatio is closer to Stava which is my baseline. The "more accurate" is achieved by using a new GPS distance calculation (Vincenty formula) and the standatd deviation to determine which points should be used for the "moving"time/distance calculation.
Suprisingly the new aggregation is not so faster as I thought ("only" 2seconds) but using the standard deviation it's faster (4sec).
Additionaly the new approach to use custom methods to caluclate the information provides more flexibility.


# Tests - ToDo
- Test that GPX Distance - Sum of all Track Distance - Sum of all Tracks Segments Distance - Sm of all Tracks Segments MovingData Distance are equal
- Test that GPX Duration - Sum of all Track Duration - Sum of all Tracks Segments Duration - Sm of all Tracks Segments MovingData Duration are equal
